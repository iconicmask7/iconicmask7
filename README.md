# 👋 Hi, I'm **Suraj S Pillai**  
### Flutter Engineer • Mobile App Security & Pentesting (OWASP MASVS)

I build **production-grade Flutter applications** using clean architecture (MVVM), **Riverpod**, modular design, and CI/CD pipelines.  
I also apply **mobile pentesting practices** to harden apps — secure auth, token protection, API hardening, runtime checks, and OWASP MASVS-aligned principles.

My strength is combining **high-quality UI/UX**, **backend engineering**, and **mobile security** into a single workflow.

## 🚀 What I Build
- 🛒 **E-commerce** apps (Flutter + Django REST)
- 🌍 **Tourism / content** apps with animations & caching  
- 💳 **Razorpay/Stripe** integrated apps  
- 📱 **Device features**: contacts, notifications, deep-links  
- 🔐 **Security-first mobile apps** (secure storage, API hardening, runtime checks)
